This project involves analyzing a dataset related to drug side effects using Python. The analysis covers various aspects such as preprocessing, handling missing data, and performing cross-analyses between side effects, drug usage periods, and other relevant features such as allergies and chronic illnesses. The code also includes data cleaning steps, date manipulation, and the use of a KNN imputer to handle missing numerical data.
